#' Last Observation Carried Forward 
#' 
#' In longitudinal studies it's common that individuals drop out before all
#' responses can be obtained. Measurements obtained before the individual
#' dropped out can be used to impute the unknown measurement(s). The last
#' observation carried forward method is one way to impute values for the
#' missing observations. For the last observation carried forward (LOCF)
#' approach the missing values are replaced by the last observed value of that
#' variable for each individual regardless of when it occurred.
#' 
#' \code{locf()} replaces \code{NA}s with the most recent non-NA prior to it.
#' 
#' The function will replace all NAs found in a vector with the last earlier
#' value not being NA. In data.frames each column will be treated as described.
#' 
#' It should be noted, that the last observation carried forward approach may
#' result in biased estimates and may underestimate the variability.
#' 
#' @name locf
#' @param x a vector, a data.frame or a matrix containing NAs.
#'  
#' @return a vector with the same dimension as x.

  # faster solution from Daniel Wollschlaeger:
  
  # corrected by 0.99.19, as this didn't handle c(NA, 3.0, NA, 5,5) correctly
  # rep(x[!is.na(x)], diff(c(which(!is.na(x)), length(x)+1)))
