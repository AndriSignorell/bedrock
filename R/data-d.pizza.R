#' Pizza delivery data
#'
#' An artificial dataset inspired by a similar dataset pizza.sav in
#' \emph{Arbeitsbuch zur deskriptiven und induktiven Statistik} by Toutenburg
#' et.al.\cr The dataset contains data of a pizza delivery service in London,
#' delivering pizzas to three areas. Every record defines one order/delivery
#' and the according properties. A pizza is supposed to taste good, if its
#' temperature is high enough, say 55 Celsius. So it might be interesting for
#' the pizza delivery service to minimize the delivery time.\cr 
#' The dataset is designed to be realistically evil. As far as the 
#' description is concerned,
#' it should pose the same difficulties that we have to deal with in everyday
#' life. It contains the most used datatypes as numerics, factors, ordered
#' factors, integers, logicals and a date. NAs are scattered everywhere partly
#' systematically, partly randomly (except in the index).
#'
#' A data frame with 1209 observations on 17 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{index}{Numeric index of the record.}
#'   \item{date}{Date of delivery.}
#'   \item{week}{week number.}
#'   \item{weekday}{Weekday (integer).}
#'   \item{area}{Factor with levels Brent, Camden, Westminster.}
#'   \item{count}{Number of pizzas delivered.}
#'   \item{rabate}{Logical, TRUE if a rebate was given.}
#'   \item{price}{Total price of delivered pizzas.}
#'   \item{operator}{Factor indicating the operator.}
#'   \item{driver}{Factor indicating the driver.}
#'   \item{delivery_min}{Delivery time in minutes.}
#'   \item{temperature}{Temperature in °C when delivered.}
